        In fact, as early as the early 1930s, there was a song called Rock&Roll in the United States, but there was no such music name at that time. This term is best known as DJ- Alan Freed first used the name "rock concert" in his radio program in 1951. It is said that New York still respects him as the king of rock music. And Bill Haley and his comet orchestra-His Comets stayed on the charts for 8 weeks with the song Rock Around The Clock in 55 years. With the help of this song, Rock is helping The world is well-known, so some people call it Rock Era in 1955, and Bill Harry also got the nickname of the father of rock.
        Early rock music sources are very wide, mainly including blues, R&B, and country music, as well as gospel music, traditional pop music, jazz, and folk music. All of these influences together form a simple blues-based song structure that is fast, suitable for dancing, and easy to remember. The first rock stars — Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, Carl Perkins, and many other stars established the rock music model , And has been followed by people for the next forty years.
        In every decade, there are always many artists copying the music of the first batch of rock musicians, and the remaining artists, some expanded the original definition of rock, and some completely broke the limitation of this genre. Pattern. From British invasion, folk rock, psychedelic rock, to hard rock, heavy metal, gorgeous rock, and punk, in fact, every branch of rock genre is loyal to the most basic structure of rock at the beginning. But once such a change happened, the traditional rock and roll gradually disappeared from the pop charts. Of course, there are some artists who have always kept their light.
        Some bands, such as the Rolling Stones and the Faces, have always adhered to the most basic rules of traditional rock, but they have made music faster and more free. Other bands, such as prototype punk the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, and the Stooges, have retained the basic musical structure, but have more threatening elements in their behavior. There are also some artists who have become rock traditionalists, such as Dave Edmunds and Graham Parker. Their songs have never left the rock mode of the late 50s and early 60s. Although the word rock has begun to refer to more and more different music styles in the past few decades after the emergence of rock, the nature of this music has never changed.

      <h1>Rock spirit</h1>
      <small>
        Regarding "Rock Spirit" and "Rock Thoughts": Most rock music lovers like to describe rock as a spirit, but there are different opinions about what it feels like. Obviously, when rock bands create rock music, they do not first have the consensus of "rock spirit" before creating it; and in the vast sea of ​​rock music, the various ideas covered may be difficult to generalize. The more representative and influential rock spirits are:
        Youth autonomy (including reflection on society or rebellion, based on different degrees of intensity);
        Love and peace (anarchism is usually also associated with it);
        Anti-religious (in European and American countries with religious background);
        Hedonism or indulgence (represented by the hard rock-pop metal-AOR period of the 80s);
        Pessimism and nihilism (represented by black metal and doom metal).
        These ideas are not unified, and sometimes even contradictory. Therefore, the rock spirit is not actually an outline or dogmatic spiritual thought, but is based on individual bands and specific works. For example, we can say with certainty that between The Beatles' "Getting Better" and the same period of The Rolling Stones' "Sympathy For The Devil", the spirit is completely different. And the bigger differences, such as the difference between The Beatles and Black Sabbath, are obviously more impossible to understand with a general rock spirit.
        People's general impression of rock and roll: popular dress, radical thinking, decadent attitude...maybe all prejudices. Rock is not just alternative, rock is not just pop, rock is not long hair, leather clothes, guitars and drums, rock and roll is more than just a shouting voice!
        Spirit and connotation
        When it comes to listening to rock, people immediately think of crazy audiences and similarly crazy musicians. It is true that excellent expressiveness and performance make rock more extraordinary appealing. However, people are paying more and more attention to the atmosphere of the venue. The crazy drums and the super shocking guitar solo have neglected the meaning of rock itself. You can also enjoy rock and roll as pop music, but rock has a more substantial inner meaning waiting for you to discover and fall in love with him. This is what the rock itself wants to express, as stated at the beginning of this entry: "Rock is not only a form of music, in fact it is an'attitude and philosophy of life'".
        Rock has connotations, at least most of them have and can be understood by others, and the expressiveness of rock can make it easier to understand. This is the so-called true expressiveness of rock, which is also different from the completeness. Popularity of commercial production. "Qualified" "rock" singers have perfectly integrated their souls and works, so there can be such a large number of excellent rock works in the world! If you want to truly understand and love it, it is very important to understand what rock and roll means. Because of the differences in regional culture, even if you don't know all the rock works, it's good to know only a few works you love very much.
